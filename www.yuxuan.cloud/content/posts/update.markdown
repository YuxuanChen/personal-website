I recently accepted a new role in Google Cloud AI as part of the Deep Learning Environments team.

So far I automated the process we use to build, test, and release our [Deep Learning VMs](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm) and [Deep Learning Containers](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-containers). In 2021, we also [announced general availability](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-containers/docs/release-notes#January_25_2021) of Deep Learning Containers.

It's only been a few months since I started in this position, so check back later for more updates!
