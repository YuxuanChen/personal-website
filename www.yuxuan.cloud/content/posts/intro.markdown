Welcome to my web site, I'm glad you made it! I'm a software engineer with 2+ YOE at [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) â€” the state-of-the-art for computer vision. We're building fast, reliable, scalable solutions in the AI/ML and computer vision space.

Most recently, my major breakthroughs at Amazon were *REDACTED UNTIL Q1* and *REDACTED UNTIL Q2*.

Some of my previous endeavors include designing and implementing ad-targeting model training & evaluation pipelines for Amazon Kindle, and developing ETL systems for [WatrHub](https://www.watrhub.com/).

I've also done web development for [Inkling](https://www.inkling.com/) and machine learning & back-end development for [BlackBerry](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/overview).

I'm always looking out for great opportunities. Reach out if you'd like to chat!
